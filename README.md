Efficiently managing network resources in 5G networks is complex due to the varying demands of different applications, fluctuating signal strength, the need for low latency, and diverse bandwidth requirements.

The project supports the development of AI models to enhance network performance, improve quality of service, and innovate in 5G networking by understanding application demands, signal strength impacts, latency optimization, and bandwidth allocation.
